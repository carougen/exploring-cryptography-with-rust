# 📘 Serious Cryptography (2nd Edition)

**Serious Cryptography** by Jean-Philippe Aumasson is a modern, practical introduction to applied cryptography. Thoroughly revised and updated, this second edition walks readers through the core ideas, mathematics, and algorithms that make encryption and secure communication work in the real world.

Rather than avoiding the math, this book provides just enough to help you truly understand how algorithms like AES, RSA, ECDSA, and SHA-3 work—and how they can break. It’s a hands-on guide to cryptography that balances accessibility with rigor.

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn

- 🔐 The basics of computational security, **attacker models**, and **forward secrecy**
- 🌐 The strengths and limitations of **TLS**, the protocol behind **HTTPS**
- ⚛️ **Quantum** computation and **post-quantum** cryptography
- ⚙️ Deep dives into **AES**, **ECDSA**, **Ed25519**, **Salsa20**, and **SHA-3**
- 🧩 Advanced techniques like **multisignatures**, **threshold** signing, and **zero-knowledge proofs**
