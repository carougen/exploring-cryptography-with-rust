# 📘 Rational Points on Elliptic Curves (2nd Edition)

**Rational Points on Elliptic Curves** by Joseph H. Silverman and John T. Tate offers a beautiful blend of algebra, geometry, analysis, and number theory. This textbook serves as both an elegant introduction to elliptic curves and an accessible doorway into arithmetic geometry and Diophantine equations. Written in a friendly and informal style, it invites readers of all levels to appreciate the unity of modern mathematics.

The book is designed for advanced undergraduates and assumes only foundational mathematical knowledge. It is rich in exercises and aims to make advanced topics approachable using tools commonly taught in undergraduate courses.
