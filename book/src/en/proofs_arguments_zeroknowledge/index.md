# 📘 Proofs, Arguments, and Zero-Knowledge

**Proofs, Arguments, and Zero-Knowledge** by Justin Thaler offers a comprehensive and modern introduction to the theory of probabilistic proofs and cryptographic arguments. This textbook provides a unified treatment of foundational techniques used in interactive proofs, SNARKs, and zero-knowledge systems. It is ideal for students and researchers interested in complexity theory, cryptography, and secure computation.

The book is self-contained and pedagogical, blending formal rigor with clear intuition. It features numerous exercises and a progressive structure, starting from classical proof systems to advanced modern protocols.

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn

- 🔁 The distinction between **proofs**, **arguments**, and **zero-knowledge proofs**
- 🎲 **Probabilistically checkable proofs** (PCPs) and their significance
- 🔐 **Interactive proofs**, **multi-prover** systems, and **non-interactive** arguments
- 🧠 Key constructions like **Freivalds** algorithm and **sum-check protocols**
- 🧩 **SNARKs**, **zk-SNARKs**, and **succinct non-interactive** arguments
- 🚧 The role of cryptographic assumptions (e.g., **collision resistance**, **knowledge soundness**)
- 📦 Applications to **verifiable computation**, **blockchain**, and **privacy-preserving** systems
