# 📘 Introduction to Modern Cryptography (3rd Edition)

**Introduction to Modern Cryptography** by Jonathan Katz and Yehuda Lindell is one of the most widely used textbooks for undergraduate and graduate courses in cryptography. This third edition builds on its predecessors by adding updated material, exercises, and clearer pedagogical structure, making it a top-tier introduction to the formal study of cryptographic security.

The book presents cryptography as a rigorous discipline, with an emphasis on **formal definitions** and **provable security**. It systematically develops the theoretical foundations behind modern cryptographic constructions while also highlighting their practical relevance.

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn

- 🔑 Foundations of modern cryptography: **computational security**, **indistinguishability**, and **reductionist proofs**
- 🧪 **Private-key encryption** and **message authentication codes**
- 🔐 **Public-key encryption** and **digital signatures**
- 💡 **Hash functions** and their role in **collision resistance** and **integrity**
- 🔄 **Pseudorandom** generators, functions, and permutations
- 🧱 Construction of **secure protocols** and **hybrid encryption**
- ⚖️ Formal security notions like **semantic security** and **chosen-ciphertext** attacks
- 🚨 **Real-world** implications of idealized models
- 🔬 **Exercises** with strong conceptual focus and formal proof structure
