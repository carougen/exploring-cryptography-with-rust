# 📘 An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography (2nd Edition)

**An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography** by Jeffrey Hoffstein, Jill Pipher and Joseph H. Silverman provides a rigorous yet accessible entry point into the mathematical foundations of public-key cryptosystems and digital signatures. Written for students in mathematics and computer science, this textbook emphasizes the theoretical underpinnings and algebraic structures behind modern cryptography.

This self-contained book introduces all necessary mathematical tools, from number theory to probability, as they are needed, making it suitable for readers with only basic linear algebra knowledge.

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn

- 🔑 Core cryptographic constructions like **Diffie–Hellman**, **RSA**, and **ElGamal**
- ✍️ Digital signature schemes including **DSA**, **RSA**, and **lattice-based** signatures
- 🧮 Mathematical foundations: **primality testing**, **factorization**, **modular arithmetic**
- 🔢 Concepts from **probability theory**, **information theory**, and **collision analysis**
- 🧱 Deep dives into **elliptic curve cryptography**, **pairing-based systems**, and **lattice cryptography**
- 🧠 Specialized constructions like **NTRU**, **digital cash**, and **homomorphic encryption**
